# Back For Seconds

This is a cookie clicker mod designed for the [finnless ruleset](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9YV1ZvQNOxQ_4LCZguFG0CW0uCEf8fkpPgFr4720E0/edit).
It is heavily inspired by Lookas123's [Extra Content Mod](https://github.com/Lookas123/ECM).

It does not modify gameplay at all, it is only an achievement pack, similar to ECM. It adds 30 more achievements for Cookies Baked This Ascension, up to 1 octotrigintillion (these do not give milk).
It also adds 6 shadow achievements:
- **Gambler's Raving Fantasy**: Cast Force the Hand of Fate 7 times from Gambler's Fever Dream in 1 second (basically just 7x offset abuse)
- **Refined Multitabber**: You have a 1 in 1 billion chance of earning this achievement every second.
- **Tolerance**: Harvest 32 sugar lumps in 1 hour.
- **Hawking Radiation**: Ascend 100 times at 1 trigintillion cookies baked each.
- **Industrial Sprawl**: Obtain a single building special that is 40 minutes in length.

and you can't forget
- **Sans Undertale**: Bake 100 trequinquagintillion cookies in 1 ascension.
